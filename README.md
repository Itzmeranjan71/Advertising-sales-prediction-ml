# 📊 Advertsing Sales prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to estimate future product demand based on advertising expenditure.  
This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict **sales** based on advertising budgets spent on **TV, Radio, and Newspaper**.

The model learns patterns from historical data and predicts sales with **high efficiency (~90%)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To build a machine learning model that predicts sales
- To analyze the impact of advertising on sales
- To evaluate model efficiency using performance metrics
